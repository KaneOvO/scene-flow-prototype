# scene-flow-prototype

A prototype of a game scene flow, simulating the general flow of the game

Communication between scenes:

We record several variables in SaveData.json that can be recorded in-game, including the player's blood level, and whether certain items were obtained, 

whether the save sprite event was reached, and the in-game volume setting.

However, in this prototype, the communication about the play part cannot be verified because our scenario does not contain the actual game content.

But you can verify the volume adjustment by clicking the gear in the upper left corner, and even if you change the scene after the adjustment, the 

previous settings are still preserved.
